          <p>Product design project for DECO1013: Physical Computing at the University of Sydney</p>
          <h2 class="h6">Duration</h2>
          <p>Aug 2018 - Nov 2018</p>
          <h2 class="h6">Role</h2>
          <p>I was the lead designer on a team comprised of 4 designers (myself, <a href="https://www.margauxthw.com/">Margaux Thwaites</a>, Ebony McCue-Shore & Christian Cerda). My responsibilities included research, ideation, 3D modelling, fabrication and finishing, video production, Arduino programming and UI design.</p>
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>With Australians cycling less often and for less time than in 2011, adLight sought to promote ridership and enhance the quality of each and every bike ride by focusing on safety, affordability and convenience.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Physical computing attempts to break free of the restrictions of regular computer interfaces &amp; hardware
          (mice, keyboards &amp; touchscreens) in order to better match the capabilities of the human body (Igoe, 2018).
          Through this, designs can be created that better integrate computer-human interactions into daily life.</p>
        <p>Cycling is a healthy form of transport that can have positive impacts on levels of physical activity, obesity
          rates, cardiovascular health, and morbidity (Pucher et al, 2010). These benefits suggest that cycling should
          be encouraged and steps should be taken to remove possible negatives to increase ridership.</p>
        <p>Bicycle safety equipment is important in protecting riders from and in crashes, however current equipment
          like helmets have low use in jurisdictions that do not require them (Everett et al, 2001). In jurisdictions
          that do require safety equipment, this translates to low use of bicycles, and hence a decrease in population
          health (Dutch Fietsersbond, 2012).</p>
        <p>Several products have been designed to reduce the downsides of bicycle safety equipment through physical
          computing, such as the <strong>Hövding</strong>, an inflatable airbag that uses motion sensors to inflate in
          the event of a crash. The Hövding attempts to reduce the inconvenience of helmets by being less bulky and more
          fashionable. The <strong>Garmin Varia</strong> series of lights use of sensors to adjust beam intensity and
          hence save battery while riding. The <strong>RTL510</strong> model uses radar to provide visual and audible
          alerts to riders and drivers. These products enhance rider safety and may encourage the population to ride
          more, however, their high prices limit their usefulness for the everyday rider.</p>
        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>A smart bike light that is cost-effective while still providing increased safety over non-smart devices.</p>
        <p>The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) from the Intel Genuino 101 will measure the velocity of the bicycle to
          detect when the light should turn on and off.</p>
        <p>An LED Module will be the light source. The LED will be dimmable and mapped to the speed of the bike, so the
          faster the bike, the brighter the LED.</p>
        <p>An Ambient Light Sensor will read the ambient light to determine when the LED should be turned on. During the
          day the light will not turn on, and at night it will.</p>
        <p>A Digital Push Button will serve as a manual override of the Ambient Light Sensor, allowing the LED to be
          turned whenever the user wishes.</p>
        <p>These features mean the rider doesn’t have to think about when to turn on their light, as it will turn on
          automatically. This increases safety by allowing riders to concentrate on riding and ensuring they can be seen
          in the dark, reducing crashes.</p>
